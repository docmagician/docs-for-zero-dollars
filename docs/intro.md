# Introduction
When you're running a startup, documentation is probably the last thing on your mind. You might think, "I’ll just skip it for now" or "I’ll do it later." And honestly, it’s not really your fault. When you're on a tight budget, you don’t want to spend money on something that feels like a "nice-to-have."

But here’s the thing, skipping it altogether can hurt you in the long run. Instead of putting it off, why not start with some free tools? It may not seem urgent now, but a little documentation early on can save you a ton of time down the road. It’ll help your team onboard new users faster, keep your product scaling smoothly, and seriously cut down on support tickets.

Here’s the good news, you don’t need a huge budget or a team of writers to get started. You can build a solid documentation workflow using just a few free, open-source tools.

This guide is here to show you how to create professional, scalable, and free documentation using tools you probably already know: Markdown, Visual Studio Code, GitHub, Docusaurus, and Netlify.

Whether you’re documenting your product for the first time or just looking to streamline your existing docs, this step-by-step guide will walk you through everything from writing in Markdown to launching a live, searchable documentation site. And yes, it’s all completely free.
