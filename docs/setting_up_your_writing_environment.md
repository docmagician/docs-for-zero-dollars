# Setting up your writing environment
When you start thinking about documentation, the first question that usually pops up is:  
“**What tool should I use to write all this?**”

That’s a totally fair question. The good news is, you don’t need anything fancy or expensive to get started.  

For this setup, we’re going to use **Markdown** as the writing format and **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as the editor. Both are lightweight, powerful, and completely free.

## Why Markdown?
Markdown is a simple, clean way to write formatted text using plain text. It lets you add headings, lists, links, and even code blocks without messing around with clunky menus or strange formatting.  

## Why Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
VS Code is a free, open-source code editor made by Microsoft. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and has excellent support for Markdown files.

It’s fast, customizable, and has a huge collection of extensions that can improve your writing workflow.

## How to set it up
### Install Visual Studio Code  
1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com
2. Click Download for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
4. Once installed, open VS Code.

### Create your documentation folder  
1. Choose a place on your computer to store your docs (e.g., Desktop or Documents)
2. Create a new folder and name it something like my-docs
3. Inside that folder, create a new file called getting-started.md
