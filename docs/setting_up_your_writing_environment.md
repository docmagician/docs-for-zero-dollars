# Setting up your writing environment
When you start thinking about documentation, the first question that usually pops up is:  
‚Äú**What tool should I use to write all this?**‚Äù

That‚Äôs a totally fair question. The good news is, you don‚Äôt need anything fancy or expensive to get started.  

For this setup, we‚Äôre going to use **Markdown** as the writing format and **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** as the editor. Both are lightweight, powerful, and completely free.

## Why Markdown?
Markdown is a super simple, clean way to write formatted text using plain text. It lets you add headings, lists, links, and even code blocks without messing around with clunky menus or strange formatting.  

## Why Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
VS Code is a free, open-source code editor made by Microsoft. It works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and has excellent support for Markdown files.

It‚Äôs fast, customizable, and has a huge collection of extensions that can improve your writing workflow.

## How to set it up
### Install Visual Studio Code  
1. Go to https://code.visualstudio.com
2. Click Download for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
3. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
4. Once installed, open VS Code.

### Create your documentation folder  
1. Choose a place on your computer to store your docs (e.g., Desktop or Documents)
2. Create a new folder and name it something like my-docs
3. Inside that folder, create a new file called getting-started.md

3. Open VS Code, click File > Open Folder, and select the folder you just created.  
   Your new Markdown file (getting-started.md) should be visible in the file explorer.  
4. Add your first content.
Before you add your content, start by adding the frontmatter (the part with ---, title, and slug) at the very top of each file. The frontmatter gives the static site generator important details about your content, like its title and how it should be displayed.
Here‚Äôs an example of what the frontmatter looks like:
```
---
title: "The name of your page"
slug: "The URL path for this page"
date: 2025-05-29
tags:
  - markdown
  - static-site
category: "Guides"
--- 
```
