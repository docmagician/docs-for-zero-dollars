# ðŸ’¸Zero Dollar Doc  
**Create great product documentation without spending a single dollar. Seriously.**  
If youâ€™re a startup in software, healthcare, aerospace, or automotive, you probably know how tough it is to stretch a limited budget.
Youâ€™ve got bigger fires to put out, and honestly, documentation often ends up on the back burner. Sound familiar?  

But hereâ€™s the thing: good docs help your users, reduce support questions, and can actually help you sell more. And you donâ€™t need a big budget or any budget to get started.  

Thatâ€™s why I created Zero Dollar Doc. Itâ€™s a simple guide to help you build solid documentation using completely free tools. No subscriptions, no hidden costs. Just stuff that works.
## Whatâ€™s in here
This repo walks you through:  
- Free tools for writing
- Static site generators
- Version control with Git/GitHub
- Free hosting options
- Starter templates and basic setups so you donâ€™t start from scratch
  
You donâ€™t need to be an expert. You donâ€™t need a team. You just need a bit of time and this guide.  
Of course, having a technical writer on board definitely helps. But if you donâ€™t, no worries. This guide will still point you in the right direction.
## Who this is for
- Startups trying to keep costs down
- Solo developers and indie hackers
- Open source maintainers
- Student projects and side gigs
- Anyone who needs docs but doesnâ€™t want to spend money on them
